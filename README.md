# Darts-games
trying slowly to create programs and eventually an app that can score a variety of darts games both 1 player and multiple

if anyone can find a better way to write the code that is already there please let me know

also i am trying to find a way to make the normal 501 and 301 games for multiple players, i can see a way of doing it by just having 2 or more variables 
with the scores and going down from there but would like elegant way of doing it
